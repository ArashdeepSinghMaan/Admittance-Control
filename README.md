# Admittance-Control
In this project, we implement admittance control on a 2D plotter setup, where the end effector is equipped with a force sensor to measure the applied external force. The primary objective is to regulate the systemâ€™s response based on external force inputs, ensuring compliant motion while maintaining precise control over the end effector. The system consists of both virtual and real mathematical models, with a PID controller responsible for computing the control input to drive the real system.
